## üöÅ How to run locally

To run the project on the localhost:

- `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
- `java -jar web/target/${artifact-name}-web-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

You can also use Maven Wrapper with:

- `chmod +x mvnw`
- `mvnw clean package -DskipTests`
- `./mvnw spring-boot:run -f web/pom.xml`

To test the local project, access port 8080 (by default) or the one that you specified:

- `http://localhost:8080/`

## üéâ How to deploy on Azure

1. Log in to [azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd). Only required once per-install.
   </br> `azd auth login`
   - If you are on Windows, install [powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)
1. Navigate to the generated project directory and run
   </br>`azd up`

After the command is executed, you can see the following log signs that the deployment was successful.

```text
