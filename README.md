# About

Jhipster Azure Spring Apps can quickly create applications that can be deployed on [Azure Spring Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/spring-apps/) with easy steps.

Documentation about Azure Spring Apps is available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps/overview)

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to use this application. Please ensure that you have them all installed locally.

- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd-install)
- [Java 17 or later](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/install) - for API backend
- [Node.js with npm (16.13.1+)](https://nodejs.org/) - for the Web frontend

## üöÄ How to generate a project

### CLI

1. Install the package with `npm i generator-jhipster-azure-spring-apps`
1. Create and navigate to a directory
1. Generate the application with `jhipster-azure-spring-apps createtodoapp`

### JHipster Online

Go to [Jhipster Online](https://start.jhipster.tech/generate-azure-application) and generate your application.

## üéâ How to deploy on Azure

1. Log in to azd. Only required once per-install.
   </br> `azd auth login`
1. Enable Azure Spring Apps feature for AZD
   </br> `azd config set alpha.springapp on`
1. Navigate to the generated project directory and run
   </br>`azd up`

After the command is executed, you can see the following log signs that the deployment was successful.

```text
